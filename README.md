# Causal-Inference
## Overview
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer. Advances in screening and treatment for breast cancer have improved survival rates dramatically since 1989. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), there are more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. The chance of any woman dying from breast cancer is around 1 in 38 (2.6%).

A common frustration in the industry, especially when it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, is that the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone. These questions can be similar to: “What will happen if I halve the price of my product?” “Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?”

Judea Pearl and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with that, but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are just beginning.

The causal graph is a central object in the framework mentioned above, but it is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely connected to the available data. The main objective of the task is to highlight the importance of the matter in a concrete way.
